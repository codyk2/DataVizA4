The question I wanted to answer for this assignment was; How do monthly sunshine hours vary across major U.S. cities, and does latitude predict sunshine patterns? I felt that the best way to visualize this data and use it to answer questions was a heat map. Due to the fact that I could use colors to distinguish hot-cold and use numerical values as well. It would also allow me to use blocks for the reader to easily tell that there are 12 months, be able to easily separate which boxes relate to which city and to better visualize the seasons from a month by month view.

I sorted the cities from north to south by latitude, this allows the reader to see if there is a relationship between latitude and sunshine patterns. I chose to use a white background so that it would bring an emphasis to the colors of the map. I thought about using a map of the United States and to map the colors on to each city but figured the box heat map would be easier to understand all 12 months. I felt that it was important to put the exact number of hours of sunshine per month on each box because the color does not give an exact relationship of how "sunny" it was. And on the end of the map I put an annual column for the reader to see how the cities ranked in total against each other and easily be able to understand it's not a part of the monthly total.

I chose a cool to warm gradient( navy -> blue -> yellow -> orange) because I felt it most easily reflected the feeling of cold to warm in a range. For the sizing of the cells I chose to use a balance of readability while still being compact, knowing that there were a lot of boxes(12 months) I needed to find a way for the reader to see information from each box but still see the whole picture. I chose to give the cities a bigger font above the latitude as the names relate more to the reader than the number. I also used a continuous gradient bar because sunshine hours are continuous data not discrete categories. I was able to facilitate communication in my visual form; the viewer being able to read across a row to see a city's seasonal pattern while reading down a column shows a comparison of the cities in the same month, letting the viewer answer multiple questions related to the data easily.

The story I was trying to tell is that northern cities like Seattle experience large seasonal swings in sunshine while on the other hand Miami stays pretty consistent in having sun all year round. But, being further south doesn't guarantee more total sunshine, San Francisco gets 2,950 annual hours, beating Miami with 2,903 hours. Which shows us that latitude predicts how much sunshine changes across seasons, but not how much sunshine a city gets overall. My design obscures year to year trends by showing only 30 year averages, it also hides geographic relationships like longitude, and makes cities with similar values hard to distinguish by color alone.
