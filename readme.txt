Which U.S. Cities Get the Most Sunshine, and When?

This visualization uses a heatmap to answer the question: how do monthly sunshine hours vary across six major U.S. cities, and what role does geographic latitude play in shaping those patterns? The cities are deliberately ordered from north to south by latitude (Seattle at 47.6 degrees N down to Miami at 25.8 degrees N) to reveal whether proximity to the equator corresponds to more consistent year-round sunshine. A sequential color scale maps hours of sunshine to color, ranging from dark navy blue (as low as 52 hours) through steel blue and pale yellow to deep amber-orange (up to 330 hours). This encoding leverages the intuitive metaphor of cool-to-warm tones representing less-to-more sunlight, making the pattern immediately recognizable without consulting the legend.

The heatmap format was chosen because it supports two key comparison tasks simultaneously: reading across a row reveals a city's seasonal arc, while reading down a column compares cities within the same month. Seattle's row shows a striking dark-to-bright-to-dark gradient, illustrating its famously gloomy winters (just 52 hours in December) and surprisingly sunny summers (312 hours in July). In contrast, Miami's row remains uniformly warm-toned, reflecting its consistently high sunshine with much less seasonal swing. An annual total column on the right provides a useful summary statistic, allowing the viewer to quickly rank cities by total sunshine. San Francisco leads at 2,950 hours per year, while Seattle trails at 2,163, a difference of nearly 800 hours driven almost entirely by winter disparities.

The most important design decisions concern what is emphasized and what is obscured. By encoding absolute monthly hours rather than daily averages, the visualization preserves the natural variation introduced by month length (e.g., February has fewer total hours in part because it has fewer days). This trade-off was intentional: total monthly hours better represent the lived experience of sunshine within a calendar month. However, this means that direct comparisons between months of different lengths require some caution. The latitude annotation beneath each city name adds geographic context without cluttering the chart, and the data source note ensures reproducibility.

Several aspects of the data are de-emphasized by this design. The heatmap does not show the precise longitude or geographic clustering of cities (for example, Seattle and San Francisco share nearly the same longitude but have very different sunshine profiles). Differences between cities with similar totals, such as New York (2,677) and Houston (2,633), are subtler and harder to distinguish by color alone, so exact values are printed within each cell to compensate. Additionally, a static heatmap cannot convey year-to-year variance or trends over time, showing only the 30-year average. Despite these limitations, the design efficiently communicates the core story: northern cities experience dramatic seasonal swings in sunshine, while southern cities enjoy more uniform brightness, and latitude alone does not fully predict a city's sunshine profile.
